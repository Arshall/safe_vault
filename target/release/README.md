This directory has been added to the repository, so that Docker can (optionally)
copy builds that were executed on the host machine. If the binary doesn't
exist, a build will be executed in the container at build time. See [this stack over flow question for more details](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31528384/conditional-copy-add-in-dockerfile)
